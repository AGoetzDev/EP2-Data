They are post-Fall society’s heroin — the drug of choice for the desperate and fucked. Petals are made in the form of nanopharmaceutical flowers, potted or with a nutrient pack attached to the stem. Plucking and swallowing the petals from the flower triggers the effects. Each flower has 1d6 + 4 petals. Multiple users may share the experience if they take the petals within 1 minute of the first one being plucked; after this all petals remaining on the flower fade to translucent white and become inert.</p><p> Petal experiences are entire scenarios in and of themselves. Some access your mesh inserts (you must enable access to your implants voluntarily; if not, the drug has no effect other than low-intensity LSD-like visual hallucinations), take control of your entoptic displays, link to secretive mesh servers and other trippers, and invade your sensorium with AR “hallucinations.” Others put you into a near-comatose state during which you go on a head trip. Normally there is a well-developed theme or plot to a petal experience, though others are just streams of thematicallylinked images.</p><p> Though illegal and suppressed in many polities, new petals appear constantly, fueled by a persistent subculture of makers and users. Petalcrafters view their work as an art form. The best petals are lovingly designed, hauntingly beautiful experiences — or sometimes terrifying. The subculture of petal use ranges from casual users who occasionally do an easy, short-duration flower to hardcore addicts who spend any time not on petals trying to hunt down the most intense and esoteric varieties. Because petals combine custom nanobots with tailored chemical payloads and access codes to mesh servers, duplicating them using fabricators is impossible, leading to an active market of crafters, dealers, and traders.</p><p> Petals sometimes contain easter eggs and rewards, called “sweets” by petal users. Getting the sweets usually requires fulfilling certain conditions within the trip, such as correctly answering questions or reaching goals. Typical sweets include skillsofts, new clothing or product designs, and custom infomorph avatars.</p><p> On the negative side, some petal trips go bad, inflicting SV 1d10 or worse.

It is only available for biomorphs (including pods and uplifts). Because of its organic nature, bioware is hard to detect in scans; genetic testing or other bio-sampling is required. Use Medicine: Biotech to diagnose, implant, or repair.</li><li>Cyberware (C) is synthetic devices either implanted within a biological body or “grown” within using nanobots. It is only available for biomorphs (including pods and uplifts). Cyberware is detectable with x-ray and radar scans. It can also be hacked like other electronics. Use Medicine: Biotech to implant, Hardware: Electronics to repair the ware itself.</li><li>Hardware (H) includes add-ons to synthetic shells. It is only available for synthmorphs, bots, and vehicles. It can be hacked. Use Hardware: Robotics or an appropriate field for vehicles to install, diagnose, and repair. Many non-ware gear items can be mounted on or incorporated into a shell’s frame as hardware (GM discretion).</li><li>Meshware (M) refers to plug-in apps that enhance infomorphs. These may also be installed with cyberbrains. They are vulnerable to mesh combat. Use Program to install, diagnose, or repair.</li><li>Nanoware (N) refers to internal nanobot systems active within a body or shell. Nanoware includes an implanted hive that maintains and refreshes the nanobots. It is available for morphs of all types. Nanoware hives are detectable like cyberware, but the bots are only detectable with nanodetectors or detailed biological sampling. Nanoware can be hacked like other electronics. Use Medicine: Biotech or Hardware: Robotics to implant/repair.</li></ul> <p>Unless otherwise noted, each ware item can only be installed in the same morph once, no matter if it is available in different forms.</p>",
