    "description": "Bioengineered from coconut crab and spider crab stock and grown to a larger (human) size, novacrabs are ideal for hazardous work environments as well as vacworker, police, or bodyguard duties. They climb and handle microgravity well and can withstand a wide range of atmospheric pressure (and sudden pressure changes) from vacuum to deep sea. They are equipped with ten 2-meter long legs, massive claws, chitinous armor, compound eyes (with human-equivalent image resolution), gills, dexterous manipu- latory digits on their fifth set of limbs, and transgenic vocal cords."

Their toes are also more articulated and now accompa- nied with an opposable thumb.

They also have increased brain mass and longevity, can breathe both air and water, and lack a skeletal structure so they can squeeze through tight spaces. Octomorphs typically crawl along in zero gravity using their arm suckers and expelling air for propulsion; in low gravity they walk on two of their arms. Their eyes have been enhanced with color vision, provide a 360-degree field of vision, and rotationally adjust to keep the slit-shaped pupil aligned with “up.” A transgenic vocal system allows them to speak."

Each individual “bug” is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The cyberbrain, cortical stack, and sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can “meld” together into various loose shapes, it is incapable of physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding. Individual bots are linked by radio and laser and are quite capable of interfacing with electronics. Swarmanoids follow swarm rules."
